# StickHeroClone
StickHeroClone Game project is developed using C#. Talking about the gameplay, it is a very simple cloned version of an android/ios game “Stick Hero“. It is an arcade game which is played with a tap. Here, the player has to tap the screen to pull down the stick pole across to another field. Be careful that the longer he/she holds it, the stick pole further extends and if the stick pole doesn’t make it to the other field, or if it goes a bit far then the stick hero will fall down which results in the game over.

Talking about the Game environment, the graphics are neatly simple and main menu contain buttons to mute and unmute sounds in game. In this project, simple sounds are added for actions such as completing the game, running, getting points for the distance traveled and constructing the bridge. Also, the project uses animation to simulate running character and display the menu completion of the game. But, unlike the original project, there are no red points used here that give extra points, and cherries are not used. Also in this project there are no additional heroes and background that the user could choose to his liking.
